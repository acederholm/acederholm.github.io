		<section class="intro">
			<p>I’ve had a long journey with mental health, and one of my most beneficial coping mechanisms has been art. It gives me a judgment-free space to express myself, release emotions, and better understand my own thoughts and conscience.</p>
			<p>I began exploring mental health more openly in my artwork last semester, and during my advanced printshop class this year, I’ve decided to create a dedicated series of prints that reflect mental health through visual art. My main purpose for this series is to let others who struggle with mental health know they are not alone—there is strength in acknowledging what we feel, and comfort in knowing that others feel it too.</p>

				<h3>Looming</h3>
				<h5>Intaglio</h5>
				<h5>Basic Printshop Spring 2025</h5>
				<p>Looming can have various interpretations depending on the viewers emotions and experiences. I created the original sketch out of sheer panic from an overwhelming amount of work during finals week. It grew to become a representation for both my anxiety and depression. Anxiety, to me, has always felt like this unknown entity watching over, just waiting to pounce. While my depression has always felt like a weight looming over me, creating an evil creature of my own thoughts. </p>
				<p>This print is an intaglio etching on a four by six inch zinc plate printed on paper. It consists of four layers, expressing the different levels of anxiety as well as the different weights of depression. This peice is entirely made of free-hand scribbles, done completely in the moment with whatever raw emotion I had at the time.</p>

				<h3>Dissociation</h3>
				<h5>Woodcut Relief Print</h5>
				<h5>Basic Printshop Spring 2025</h5>
				<p>This woodcut relief print depicts the feeling of dissociating through anxiety, depression, or everyday life. The person carved with messy scribbles expresses the internal chaos of ones mind. The circles that surround the person aim to show the peaceful and protecting bubble created by dissociation, while also depicting the false ssense of security created by dissociation shown through the eeriness and uncertainty of the lines. Lastly, the harsh downward strokes represent the metaphorical feeling of pouring rain when times are tough. Together, the peice shows an anxious, worried human surrounded by their minds attempt to find safety in a harsh world.  </p>

				<h3>Sketchbook Art</h3>
				<p>I sketch a lot when I feel overwhelmed or emotional. Some sketches are pages of scribbles, circles, or squares, while others are visualizations of my thoughts. I decided to dedicate a section to certain sketchbook art I would like to share.</p>
